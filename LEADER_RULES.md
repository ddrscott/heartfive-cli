# Leader Rules in Heart of Five

## How Leadership Works

1. **Initial Leader**: Player with Three of Hearts (3H) starts the first round
2. **Leader Privileges**: Can play ANY meld type (single, pair, triple, etc.)
3. **Followers Must Match**: Other players must match the meld type or play bombs

## When Leadership Changes

### Scenario 1: Everyone Passes
When all other players pass after someone plays:
- The last player who played wins the trick
- They become the new leader
- Meld type resets - leader can play ANY type again

**Example:**
```
Alice (Leader) plays: 5H (Single)
Bob plays: 7S (Single) 
Cat passes
You pass
Alice passes

→ Bob wins the trick! Bob is now the leader.
→ Bob can now play ANY meld type (single, pair, triple, etc.)
```

### Scenario 2: Round Winner
When someone plays their last card:
- They win the round
- Next round: Player with 3H becomes leader

## Key Points

- **Established Style Resets** when a new leader is chosen
- **Bombs Can Always Be Played** regardless of established style
- **Leader Sets the Pace** by choosing favorable meld types

## Strategy Tips
