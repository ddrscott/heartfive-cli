## How to Play

### Card Ranking

**Single Card Strength (Weakest to Strongest):**
```
3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A < 2 < jj < JJ < 5H
```

**Special Cards:**
- **Small Joker (jj)**: Second strongest single card
- **Big Joker (JJ)**: Third strongest single card
- **Five of Hearts (5H)**: Strongest single card (game namesake)

**Run/Straight Ranking (Different from singles):**
```
A < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A
```

### Meld Types

1. **Single Card**: Any individual card
2. **Pair**: Two cards of same rank (no jokers allowed)
3. **Triple**: Three cards of same rank
4. **Full House**: One pair + one triple (5 cards)
5. **Sisters**: 2+ consecutive pairs or triples
6. **Run/Straight**: 5+ consecutive cards (uses run ranking)
7. **Four of a Kind Bomb**: All four cards of same rank
8. **Straight Flush Bomb**: 5+ card run in same suit

### Game Flow

1. Player with **Three of Hearts** starts the first round
2. **Lead player** can play any valid meld type
3. **Following players** must match the meld type or play a bomb
4. **Bombs** can break style rules and beat any non-bomb meld
5. **Straight flush bombs** beat four-of-a-kind bombs
6. When all others pass, the last player to play becomes the new leader
7. **First to empty their hand** wins the round

## Commands

pass            # Pass your turn
hand            # Display your current hand
legal           # Show all legal moves
history         # Show recent play history
score           # Show win/loss records
help            # Display command help
```

### Hand Management
```bash
sort rank       # Sort hand by rank strength
sort suit       # Sort hand by suit
```

### Card Notation

## Development

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Run in development mode
npm run build     # Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm test          # Run test suite
npm run lint      # Type checking
npm start         # Run built application
```

npm run test:watch         # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Run with coverage report
```

### Configuration

The game can be customized through configuration files or the `ConfigManager`:

```typescript
import { ConfigManager } from './src/config/ConfigManager';

// Create a speed game (3 rounds, faster bots)
const speedConfig = ConfigManager.createSpeedGameConfig();

// Create a tournament (15 rounds, all advanced bots)
const tournamentConfig = ConfigManager.createTournamentConfig();

// Create a beginner-friendly game
const beginnerConfig = ConfigManager.createBeginnerConfig();
```

## Game Variations

The modular design allows for easy creation of game variations:

- **Speed Game**: 3 rounds, faster bot thinking
- **Tournament**: 15 rounds, all advanced difficulty bots
- **Beginner Mode**: 5 rounds, easier bots with longer thinking time

## Technical Details

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns between game logic, AI, and UI
- **Extensible AI**: Strategy pattern allows for easy addition of new bot behaviors
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for all game mechanics and edge cases
- **Configurable**: JSON-based configuration with validation
